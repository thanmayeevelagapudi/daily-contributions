Day 1 - Starting GitHub Contributions

From today, I’ve decided to start using GitHub regularly to track my coding progress.

Today, I made small improvements to my EduQuizPortal project:
- Fixed a few typos in the README file
- Improved some code comments in both frontend (Angular) and backend (Spring Boot) files
- Cleaned up unused imports in one backend class

It wasn’t a big coding day, but it’s a step toward consistency.
